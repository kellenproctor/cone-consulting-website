description: >-
  Even experienced companies with a long history in the CPT market struggle with 
  inefficiencies in their working process. Many do not realise that by taking 
  steps to mitigate these issues, they can lower costs, increase productivity, 
  retain key staff, and increase their future business generation.

      title: Onsite Consultation
      text: >
        Onsite means with you, wherever we can help you best. This can be onsite 
        with your production team, in the boardroom with your decision makers, 
        or in front of your customers.  CCL will offer guidance and expertise 
        from the preparatory works to application of invoice, including; 
        tendering for a CPT project, selecting and purchasing the best equipment 
        for the job, writing method statements, onsite production, data 
        interpretation and reporting. CCL will help critically assess your 
        operation, identifying, and importantly, helping you to eliminate 
        pitfalls, bad practices and inefficiencies from your working process 
        raising productivity, reducing costs, avoiding unmanageable 
        specifications and producing data of the highest quality.  

        Not the contractor? If you are subcontracting a CPT specialist to 
        undertake the works on your behalf, then you need to know best 
        practices, international standards and project specifications are 
        adhered to, production is high and that the data provided is reliable 
        and accurate.

      title: Remote Support
      text: >
        Many issues encountered during the lifetime of a CPT project can be 
        solved remotely by getting the information you need when you need it.  

        CCL are available to our remote clients by phone, email and video 
        conference call whenever you need us. We understand that when a problem 
        needs to be solved, it needs to be solved immediately. By addressing 
        problems when they arise, we can help you eliminate the need for costly 
        retests as well as limiting potential loss of earnings due to not 
        satisfying project requirements.

      title: Data Analysis, Validation, and Reporting
      text: >
        CPT data contributes to, and in some cases forms the basis of, many 
        aspects of civil engineering including; foundation design, bearing 
        capacity analysis and ground improvement strategy. The consequences of 
        inaccurate, misleading or poorly reported geotechnical data are 
        catastrophic.  

        CCL’s detailed reports not only present the raw and processed CPT data, 
        but also give comments on the data quality and reliability giving your 
        customer confidence in your results. Our reports are not copy and paste 
        tasks, but instead each CPT is carefully studied and eccentricities in 
        the data along with patterns within the dataset are highlighted and 
        explained. Allow us to answer the questions top-level engineers will 
        raise before they are even asked.  

        If you are basing your geotechnical design on CPT data then you want to 
        know it is data you can rely on. If you do not see the CCL seal of 
        approval, then seek it. We will analyse and validate the quality of the 
        data you are purchasing to assess whether it is up to standard, and if 
        not then, why not.

      title: Coaching and Courses
      text: >
        Give a man a fish and he will eat for a day, you know how the saying 
        goes. Our mission at CCL is to boost knowledge and understanding of all 
        aspects of the CPT. We aim to equip our partners with the tools to 
        handle issues at all levels of the CPT process with confidence and 
        clarity. The bulk of this learning occurs naturally through our onsite 
        and offsite consultation, however, some topics are much more efficiently 
        delivered in a classroom coaching environment.  

        We offer a range of courses aimed at specific parts of the CPT 
        operation, for example, project coordination, dissipation testing and 
        data processing. Our courses are not conducted just by reeling off 
        slides from a PowerPoint and hoping our partner will see improved 
        results. Our courses will be tailored to your specific project and 
        learning objectives. We will teach the theory and coach the changes 
        until they are a natural part of your working processes. Knowledge and 
        inherent understanding of CPT are the tools that will allow you to 
        maximise your business and prevent unnecessary loss of earnings.
