## What is CPT
Cone Penetration Testing (CPT) is an in-situ ground investigation technique deployed in soils. During a CPT an instrumented cone is advanced into the ground at a constant rate by hydraulic force. In a standard test the cone measures; cone resistance, sleeve friction and pore water pressure. However many specialist forms of CPT now exist yielding extra measurements and deriving advanced parameters such as conductivity, seismic wave velocity and magnetic response. The cone is connected to a data acquisition system on the surface and provides data in real time at a high sample rate of a measurement per 10mm.

## Advantages
### In-situ testing
Being an in-situ testing method CPT measures the stress response of soils in their in-situ state delivering parameters hard to assess with lab testing and other sample driven investigations even compared with undisturbed sampling. In-situ testing also removes the risk of recovery loss as well as the need to handle potentially harmful materials.

### Rapid testing and real time data
Compared with drilling led investigations CPT is fast with upwards of 200m of testing being achievable in a single day. On top of this data is available in real time and there is no lengthy wait for samples to be sent to a laboratory and tested.

### High data resolution
During a CPT data points are collected every 10mm producing a dense data set allowing more confidence in results, reducing the impact of outliers and allowing the delineation of narrow stratigraphies.

### Testing sensitivity
CPT equipment consists of sophisticated and highly calibrated measuring devices that are sensitive to small strains. Subtle variations in soil properties such as changes of Undrained Shear Strength of only a few kPa are detectable by the CPT.

##History of CPT
The first cone penetrometer was invented by Mr Pieter Barentsen and built by the Gouda Machine Factory in The Netherlands in 1932. In 1953 the friction sleeve was added upgrading the technique to a two parameter test, this techniques is still in use today and referred to as Mechanical CPT. However in a mechanical CPT cone resistance and sleeve friction measurements are conducted one after the other and the test is not continuous in nature.

Electrical CPT came about in 1965 and in 1980 the first piezocones were deployed combining existing piezometers into CPT cones and allowing the measurement of pore water pressure alongside cone resistance and sleeve friction. Since then many rapid developments have occurred. Specialist cones such as seismic, magnetometer and soil moisture probes (SMP) are deployed around the world boosting the offering of geotechnical parameters derived from cone penetration testing data.
